## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk by typing: '''{r} and closing it with: ''' OR, you can click the +c green icon at the top and add an R code chunk, which will appear grayed out:

```{r}
```

You can add notes in the R code chunk too, using a '#'.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# include=FALSE means that this particular R code chunk will not be included in the final report. Useful for global settings or bits of code that might not be necessary to show in the final report (settings/set-up lines of code).
if (!("knitr" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages('knitr', repos='http://cran.rstudio.org')}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, error = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
#this line is used to specify any global settings to be applied to the R Markdown script.   The example sets all code chunks as “echo=TRUE”, meaning they will be included in the final rendered version, whereas error/warning messages or any other messages from R will not be displayed in the final, 'knitted' R Markdown file.
```


## Analysis and Reporting Using Pre-Loaded Datasets (cars & pressure)

```{r}
summary(cars)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```


## Analysis and Reporting Using Our Own Data

# Loading the Data

1. place the MockData.csv file (also in Class 1 folder of the Course GitHub page) in a folder in your computer, and specifically the same folder where you have saved this RMarkdown file

2. Set your working directory (i.e. folder where you have your data and RMarkdown file saved): you can do it either using the setwd() command, or, more simply by clicking "Session" in the menu above, then "Set Working Directory" and then "To Source File Location".

```{r}
MyDataSet<-read.csv("MockData.csv")
```

# Simple analysis

We want to summarise the number of males and females in the mock dataset. We will do it starting with a simple numerical summary, via a frequency tables and via a barplot.

Numerical summary:

```{r}
summary(MyDataSet$female)
```

The numerical summary reveals to us that there are more females than males in our dataset since the mean is above 0.5 - i.e. meaning that we have more 1s (female indicator) than 0s in our data. Numerical summaries are not particularly suited for discrete variables such as gender however! Better to use tables.

To present the information in tabular format use the R functions below:

```{r}
#simple table
table(MyDataSet$female)
#renaming the variable values
if (!("expss" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("expss")}
library(expss)
val_lab(MyDataSet$female) = num_lab("
             0 Male 
             1 Female    
")
#table of relative frequencies
prop.table(table(MyDataSet$female))
#better looking table (it also provides a rough graph as added bonus!)
if (!("epiDisplay" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("epiDisplay")}
library(epiDisplay)
tab1(MyDataSet$female, cum.percent = TRUE)
```

The frequency and relative frequency tables are more informative as they tell us that we have 6 females and 5 males in our datasets, or 54.5% females (compare this to the 0.545 mean from the numerical summary results!) and 45.5% males. Visualising these frequencies via barplots would also be nice.

Creating a barplot with ggplot:

```{r}
if (!("ggplot2" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")}
library(ggplot2)
p1<-ggplot(data=MyDataSet, aes(x=factor(female))) +
  geom_bar(stat="count", width=0.7, fill="gray") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title="Gender of Respondents", 
         x=" ", y = "Count")
p1
```

```{r}
# Horizontal bar plot
p1 + coord_flip()
```



## Exercise

Do the same analyses for the Left-Right variable!
