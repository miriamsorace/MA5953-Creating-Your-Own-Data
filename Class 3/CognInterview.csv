11/16/2022 10:24:44,Agree,I thought about the work I have done last year and in earlier modules this year. I have used most of the feedback given to me so it has been useful.,Comments that inform me on what to do to improve and one’s that I use in later assessments.,1,Neutral,I thought about what modules I thought were better structured than others and how much information I received from all of them,A course that provides good information and support throughout.

11/16/2022 10:27:46,Agree,"Over the course of my degree I received a good amount of feedback on various pieces of work I submitted as well as getting verbal feedback from work done in seminars. Despite most of these comments being helpful, there are multiple occasions in which the comments I received were not helpful as they were very minimal. For examples, simply seeing the word 'good' in response to submitted work. Therefore, I could only select 'agree' as opposed to 'strongly agree'.","I define 'helpful comments' and clear and consistent, constructive comments that can directly be applied to not only the work I submitted but also can be implemented in future work in order to improve it. Comments that are too specific to the individual piece of work don't have much value going forward.",2,Agree,"Most of the teaching that I experienced over the course was good and I felt like I was actively learning throughout the year. However, this was not always the case due to either lecturers or seminar leaders being seemingly disinterested or strike action meaning I missed a week (or sometimes weeks) of content.","Course quality, for me, relates to the quality of the face-to-face classes. Not simply how many contact hours you have but how involved you feel in those classes and leaving feeling that you have a better and deeper understanding of the subject. There should also be reliable and multiple avenues for help both academically and mentally in order to feel confident in the subject and supported through potential difficulties.",2,Female,White
11/16/2022 10:28:11,Agree,I recalled the previous times that i recieved feedback on my assessment. I then thought about how useful the comments were and how they would help me improve moving forward,Comments from the lecturer that allow me understand what I've done well and what I can improve on so that I don't repeat mistakes.,1,Agree,I thought about my personal experiences. How I found it interesting and how many assessments there are how much time I have to pursue my other interests and hobbies.,How engaging and interesting the topic is to learn. Aswell as how it will further my future career goals.,2,Male,Asian/Asian British

11/16/2022 10:30:12,Agree,I thought about what comments I received on assignments and whether or not they helped me understand where I went wrong. I had to try to think generally about uni work this year but then I wondered if it means general work as opposed to assessments,"It means receiving spoken or written feedback about something. It can be positive or negative so I can understand if what I am doing is right and I should carry on, or if I am doing something wrong the comment can explain why that is wrong and what can be done about it. ",2,Agree,"I thought about my year in data course and my physics degree so far and despite there being some issues here and there overall it is all okay. I thought about how the course is delivered, how well I am doing (eg I have learnt new things).","It captures the way that a course is delivered, support available ",2,Male,White
11/16/2022 10:30:41,Neutral,"I am currently in my 4th year of University, and so I have handed in many pieces of work which I have later received feedback on. In all honesty, the majority of this feedback has been pretty useless to me as I am receiving it AFTER I have finished a module, where those particular skills were useful. Yes, there are some aspects which spread across different modules and assessments, but specific feedback rarely addressed this. Usual feedback was concerned with the content of a particular essay. I'm not going to rewrite the essay. I'm likely not going to look into the topic again in much detail during my degree. therefore it is hard to call most of the feedback useful. The reason it is neutral is because my academic advisor did help me lots to improve essays. But i went to her, and she wasn't specifically marking my assessments.",It would mean a general tendency of feedback to be of use to me later in my degree.,4,Neutral,"This module, so far, seems to be useful and interesting. And most importantly seems to be taught. Intro to Data was basically an exercise in googling the answers, and we were largely expected to teach ourselves how to code. bad vibes. Also, the assessment was difficult because the data given didn't really seem to match up to the work we had done in seminars. worse vibes.  understanding /synthesising research is fine. the module is taught enthusiastically but tbh it seems a bit pointless to anyone who has just done 3 years of a social sciences degree. Also a group presentation of 15 minutes seems a bit of an easy way to get off marking all of our work. especially when we havent picked our groups.",usefulness/ ease of understanding to students.,1,Male,White
11/16/2022 10:30:50,Strongly Agree,"I recalled infomation on my work at university over the last four years as that is how I assessed what the question meant by 'work' - school work in the university setting. I considered ""helpful comments"" a feedback on marked essays and one to one office hours with lecturers and their feedback for essay plans was invaluable to my improvement of work and high grade attainment through 1st to 3rd year in history and politics. The same can be said for this year however we havent yet had alot of feedback on the few written assignments submitted thus far.","I considered ""helpful comments"" a feedback on marked essays and one to one office hours with lecturers and their feedback for essay plans. ",2,Agree,"I consider the course in question to the just the Year in Data Analytics, not my entire 4 year course, as this survey was issued in a Data Analytics module and thus seemed more specific. My answer was given because I haven't completed the course and cannot comment on its overall quality yet so i cannot answer with strong agreement. I am happy with the intensity of work so far and feedback has been good, however some sessions have felt less connected to the rest of the course than others","Intensity of classes, how much I have felt i have learnt from classes, effort of teaching on behalf of the lectures and module conveners, feedback and help from module conveners, ability of course to strengthen my CV and ",3,Male,White
